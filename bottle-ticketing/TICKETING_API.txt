REQUEST TICKET
==============

 "{
    "file": <file_path>,
    "downloads":<number_of_downloads>,
    "timeout":<minutes>
  }"

  - "file": This is the file path or file name to request a ticket for.
  - "downloads": This is the maximum allowed downloads. After the file is downloaded <number_of_downloads> times, it wont be accessible with this ticket. A number of downloads of 0 means no limit of downloads.
  - "timeout": Number of minutes for the ticket to be available. After this number of minutes, the ticket will be invalid and the file wont be accessible through this ticket. A number 0 means no limit of time.

   NOTE: If you specify both <number_of_downloads> and <minutes>, the ticket will be unavailable when any of those limits is reached.

   IMPORTANT: Timeout is prefered as sometimes it is hard to detect if a download was completed successfully and without any corruption during transmission.



ANSWER TO REQUEST
=================

 "{
    "file":<file_path_of_requested_file>,
    "ticket":<string_representing_ticket_id>,
    "URL":<url_for_the_ticket>,
    "status": [ "OK" | "FAIL" ],
    "error": <error_message>
 }"

    - "file": the same file name or file path than the requested
    - "ticket": a uniq string 
    - "URL": url for downloading the file using the ticket. Probably something like "http://downloads.domain.com/ticket/<ticket_string>"
    - "status": status code
    - "error": error message if something goes wrong

    If the request goes properly, the "status" will be "OK" and "error" will be an empty string.
    If there was an error, "status" will be "FAIL" and "ticket" and "URL" will be empty strings. "error" will contain the error message that for now we can describe two:
      - "not found": Requested file was not found on the system so no ticket was generated.
      - "internal error": Some proble occurred during the ticket creation.: Some proble occurred during the ticket creation.

      The tickets will be generated as UUIDs, so they will look like this:
